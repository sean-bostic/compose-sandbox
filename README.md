# Compose Sandbox
A multiplatform focused sandbox to allow quick prototyping and debugging using Compose Preview. My intentions with this sandbox are to keep it as a place to build with Compose with a focus on reusable compasables that can be used seamlessly for iOS, Desktop, and Android. If there are more efficient ways to get faster loaded compose changes, I'd be very keen to learn them.

My experience with compose has been good except for eactually seeing the changes quickly in the UI. The quickest route that I've come to is to see my compose changes as fast as possible, I need to label with `@Preview` a `fun` taht calls the Composable in MaterialTheme{} to then be "previewed" with Compose Preview which needs Android Emulator under the hood to work. Once changes are made to composable the "Preview" window has a `Build & Refresh` looking button to load the changes in. As far I as know, there is no way to "hot load" changes for Compose and this is unfortunately the quckest way to see changes _nearly_ instantly.

## General Structure and How-To Use
- Open `compose-sandbox` in Android Studio and perform Gradle Sync
- Create a new package for each new feature and place mock data objects and composables in the `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/<feature-name-here>` path
- Create a simple preview in `androidApp/src/main/kotlin/` with the @Preview annotations for each instance of the mock data object.
- Run Preview from the gutter and `Build & Refresh` on every code change for the composable

Sample Preview Setup
```kotlin
@Preview(name = "Pumping ðŸš€ðŸš€", showBackground = true)
@Composable
fun XrpPriceCardPumpingPreview() {
  MaterialTheme {
     XrpPriceCard(MockData.pumpingXrp)
  }
}
```
